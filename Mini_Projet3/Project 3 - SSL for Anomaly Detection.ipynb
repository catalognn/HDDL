    "#### The objective of this mini-project is to train compare different SSL strategies by evaluating them on an Anomaly Detection downstream task. \n",
    "\n",
    "You will be using two anomaly detection datasets:\n",
    "\n",
    " • The MVTec AD datase (download from MVTec AD). Perform your exper\n",
    "iments on AT LEAST the following categories: bottle, hazelnut, capsule,\n",
    " toothbrush.\n",
    " \n",
    " • The AutoVI dataset (download from AutoVI). Perform your experiments\n",
    " ONLY on the following category: engine wiring.\n",
    " \n",
    "####  For each of the categories, you are asked to:\n",
    " \n",
    " • Train AT LEAST three different SSL models (masked autoencoder, con\n",
    "trastive model, inpainting model, colorizing model, siamese network...) using\n",
    " only the normal, training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "• Use the model loss as an anomaly score and evaluate the anomaly score’s\n",
    " discriminative power by plotting the ROC curve and the AUROC metric.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Points will be awarding according to the following criteria:\n",
    "\n",
    "• The notebook is clearly written, contains markdown cells with all necessary\n",
    " explanations, and the code cells are well commented.\n",
    "\n",
    "• Explanation and arguments of the different model choices, architecture choices\n",
    " and hyper-parameter choices (which need not be the same for all categories!).\n",
    "\n",
    "• Clear comparison and visualization of the results (plots, tables...)\n",
    " Extra bonus points will be awarded according to the following criteria:\n",
    "\n",
    "• Originality of the model choice (i.e. choosing models different than those\n",
    " seen during the TP)\n",
    "\n",
    "• Theobtained AUROC metrics will be compared between different teams and\n",
    " bonus points will be given according to the rankings"
